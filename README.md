## Description

Dev-Blog is a dynamic blogging platform designed to provide users with an engaging way to create, manage, and interact with blog posts. The project leverages Express.js and Sequelize to handle user authentication and data management, while Materialize CSS ensures a modern, responsive design. With Dev-Blog, users can easily post their thoughts, comment on others' entries, and navigate through the content with a sleek, mobile-friendly interface. The integration of Materialize CSS offers a polished and accessible user experience, making it easier for developers to focus on content rather than design challenges.

## Installation

To set up and run Dev-Blog locally, start by cloning the repository using git clone https://github.com/demichele-c/dev-blog.git and navigate to the project directory. Install the necessary dependencies with npm install. Create a .env file in the root directory and add your environment variables for database access and session secrets. Seed the database with npm run seeds to populate it with initial data. Finally, start the server using npm start and access the application by opening http://localhost:3001 in your web browser.

## Usage

To use the Dev-Blog application, start the server with npm start, which will run the application on http://localhost:3001 or simply navigate to the deployed website at https://dev-blog-je23.onrender.com/. When visiting the site for the first time, users are presented with the homepage, which displays existing blog posts, navigation links to the homepage and dashboard, and an option to log in. Clicking the homepage link keeps users on the homepage, while other navigation links prompt them to sign up or sign in. Upon choosing to sign up, users are prompted to create a username and password, and clicking the sign-up button saves their credentials and logs them into the site. When revisiting the site and signing in, users enter their username and password. Once signed in, users see navigation links for the homepage, dashboard, and the option to log out. Clicking the homepage link shows existing blog posts with titles and dates, and selecting a post displays its title, content, creatorâ€™s username, and creation date, along with an option to comment. Submitting a comment saves and displays it with the username and date. Clicking the dashboard link shows any blog posts the user has created, with an option to add new posts. Adding a new post prompts the user to enter a title and content, saving it, and updating the dashboard. Users can update or delete their posts from the dashboard. Clicking the logout option signs the user out, and being idle on the site for more than five minutes allows viewing posts and comments but requires logging in again to add, update, or delete posts.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to the Dev-Blog project! To contribute, please follow these steps: First, fork the repository on GitHub and clone it to your local machine. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix by running git checkout -b your-branch-name. Make your changes and test them thoroughly. When you're ready, commit your changes with a descriptive message using git commit -m "Your descriptive message", and push the branch to your forked repository with git push origin your-branch-name. Submit a pull request from your branch to the main repository. Ensure that your code adheres to our coding standards and passes all tests. We appreciate your contributions and will review and merge them as soon as possible. If you have any questions or need help, feel free to open an issue in the repository.

## Tests

To test your Dev-Blog API using Insomnia, open the Insomnia application and create a new request by selecting the appropriate HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and entering the URL for the endpoint you wish to test. For endpoints that require a request body, such as POST or PUT, navigate to the "Body" tab and input your JSON data. If the endpoint requires headers, add them under the "Headers" tab (e.g., Content-Type: application/json). Click "Send" to execute the request and review the response in the lower section of the Insomnia window. Ensure that the response data, status codes, and any error messages are consistent with your expectations. Repeat this process for various endpoints to confirm the API's functionality.
